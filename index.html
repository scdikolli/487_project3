      In 2018, according to the National Gun Archive, there have been 307 mass shootings this year, so far. The latest? Today. Thousand Oaks, California. 13 killed and 2 injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other years show similar trends, over 300 mass shootings a year in America. (The National Gun Archive defines a mass shooting as a single event where four or more people were shot or killed at the game general location and time.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The issue of gun violence in America prevails, and has been prevailing since 1982. In the public eye, a concern over mass school shootings has increased since the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Connecticut. Such incidents are becoming almost familiar for the younger generation of American people, especially those that fall into the demographic of many school shooting victims. There are millions of young Americans that appear to hear about a new school shooting more often than not.

      Since 1990, high schools have been the location with the greatest number of school shootings over middle schools and colleges. High school students, and some now former students, growing up this heightened political atmosphere are unlocking a new tool for change: a vote. As students turn 18, they enter into the voting age population increasing the youth perspective in politics. As of 2018, Generation X and younger are the majority of eligible voters (135 million) over Baby Boomers and older (93 million), according to the Pew Research Center.

      These young adults have not only lived through mass school shootings such as Sandy Hook, Santa Fe, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas, they have lived through these incidents as students. Students who were in the exact same position as any of the victims from the previous incidents.

      The Harvard Institute of Politics publishes the National Youth Final biannually to examine civic engagement and political opinions of Americans ages 18 to 29. In the Fall 2018 National Youth Poll, interviewees were asked if they approve or disapprove of how Donald Trump is handling various issues. One of the top percentages of disapproval among the issues was gun violence in which 65% of voters aged 18-29 disapproved its handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young adults are not happy with the current and seemingly continued issue of gun violence in America. A key to changing this actuality is voting. And with the increase of this young generation into the voting age population there is a possibility for change.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the next step for these young adults? For one, there is strong support among teens for gun policy proposals focused on mental illness, according again to the Pew Research Center.
